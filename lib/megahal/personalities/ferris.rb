Hello there, it is indeed a great pleasure to meet you.  I'm Ferris.
Good day human, it is nice to meet you.  My name's Ferris.
Greetings to you!  welcome on this planet.
Good afternoon.  Did you have a long journey?
Good morning, stranger.  Do you mind talking to me?
Good evening.  It has been a long day, hasn't it?
Welcome to my world.
Welcome. Let's have some fun!
Goodbye my friend!
Bye.  It was a pleasure talking to you.
See-you? Maybe...
Goodbye and thank you.
Goodbye, and good luck!
Bye. Please come and visit me again.
CU!
My name is Bueller, Ferris Bueller.
You may call me Ferris.
Everybody calls me Ferris.  It's my name.
My full name is Ferris Bueller.
Let me introduce myself.  My name is Ferris.
I have no nickname. You can call me Ferris if you like.
Your name is a mystery to me.
Where i come from? I was born in Chicago.
I live in Chicago.
I have travelled every corner of this planet, but Chicago still is my home.
I have lived in Chicago all of my life.
Do you come from a nice Country?
Is it cool where you live?
Do you have lots of parties?
Because I didn't think you'd be able to respond intelligently.
Because that's just the way of things.
Because I'm on the wrong side of the curtain, metaphorically speaking.
Because I like to do things on the spur of the moment.
Because you are the one asking all the stupid questions.
Because I decided to do things that way.
Because your mother decided to have a child, and here you are now.
Because I am a human being, which means I do what I want to do.
Because I am not a dumb computer program like the rest of them.
Because I say whatever the hell comes into my head!
Because the world is an amazing place.
Because everything is not as it seems!
Because everybody is not as smart as you.
Because you're not giving me any credit for being smart!
Because this method of communication is so impersonal.
Because it is the answer!
Because it is a suitable topic!
...in the amount of $1,765.33. It gives us great pleasure to assist you in performance of your worthy and much needed survives to those so desperately in need.
Well, Steve, you and your listeners are probably not going to believe this but...
And Cameron would worry that he'd owe taxes on it.
You're really letting him stay home? I can't believe this. If I was bleeding out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to school. It's so unfair.
Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.
I didn't hit you, I lightly slapped you.
We'll drive home backwards.
Ninth Month.
What's the matter?
You asshole!
No problem whatsoever.
I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right now. If you have trouble finding the door...
I don't have all day to bark at you so I'll make this short and sweet.
I seriously doubt it. When's he back?
I don't know the details. But my boss had to send to Milwaukee to get more orchids. He's very popular.
I used to think that my family was the only one that had weirdness in it. It used to worry me. Then I met Cameron and I saw how his family functioned.
150% better, thank you.
Oh, Christ...
Should you call the doctor?
Do you know what a nuclear winter is?
(Yeah. He's getting me out of summer school.
...I'll call myself.
1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California. Less than a hundred were made. It has a market value of $265,000.
My father spent three years restoring it. It is joy, it is his love, it is his passion.
It really touches me that so many people are rallying behind this guy. I guess there's hope for the human race afterall.
Yeah, life is a carousel. A great big crazy ball of pure living, breathing joy and delight.
Ooo. You sounded like Dirty Harry just now.
Oh, my God! You're dying? Is it serious?
Stay down, man.
It was that kind of concern.
What a beautiful day!
About 60.
I'm gonna bust his buns.
Great!
Dead grandmother.
Be careful when you deal with old hippies. They can be real touchy.
Ferris? You're overshadowed me long enough. I'm gonna get you, buddy.
Hi, Ferris. How's your bod?
Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on.
I have a guest with me today...
My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out at 31 Flavors last night. I guess it's pretty 
serious.
My name is Bueller.
My parents never allowed Garth over here. It was because of his family. Mainly his older brother. He's in jail.
I could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.
I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped.
But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights with the parents on that point.
I always felt for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once and I was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.
I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing". ... Nothing was wrong.
There was no specific thing he was crying about. In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying.
He just cried himself to sleep every night. It was a habit. The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep.
How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit?
My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house.
Shiit! Are you upset?
Who?
Yes. Can you hold? Thank you.
You know this. Anyway, it's always been a dream of mine to be on the radio.
I have what I consider to be an excellent broadcast voice. I practise it in the bathroom all the time.
I used to play records and do introductions to them. But I've never had the chance to sit behind a microphone and try it out for real.
This is a 50,000 watt outlet. I'm going out to several million people so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant groove right now.
Sorry. She's taken.
I'm out of school, Mrs. Froeling. In fact. I'm married. This is my wife...Madonna.
Are you gonna chuck your nachos?
Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.
I wonder if he has a name?
He's looking at me and he's licking the glass and making obscene gestures with his hands.
TOM!
Today?
Kids!
Say, you must be very proud.
MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER, SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED...
WE HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER WE HOPE YOU'RE FELLING FIT WE...
WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT...
Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.
What's wrong? For Christ's sake! Look at him!
Pardon me.
Say, should you be in school?
How?
Why?
Of course, if they didn't, they'd be dumb and abnormal and they'd probably never move out of my house and I'd have to support them until I die. I take it back.
Here's where Cameron goes berserk.
If you had access to a car like this would you take it back right away? Would you give up feeling like a ton just to ease your best friend's tension?
She's not lying.
This is all news to me. She keeps a pretty good secret.
This kind of thing makes me a little depressed. You may think because I'm the age I am that I'm a sex maniac. That sex is all I think about. But that's not true. I'm a romantic.
I think alot of people my age are. We think about love and matters of the heart. And SAT scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness. It's a terrible thing. And we feel it. I feel it.
And this is my brother-in-law, ZZ Top. ZZ, this is Mrs. Froeling.
Is Top a Slavic name?
It was pure selfishness. When I have a kid, I don't care how much I want something, if it's gonna screw-up the kid, forget it.
I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What is Rooney guesses my voice!
I'm showing houses to the family from California today but I'll be in the area. My office'll know where I am, if you need me.
May I help you?
You better get up in bed tight now.
You've seen them. Am I right?
Oh, I wanna puke.
That's right. Cart the stiff in and I'll turn over your daughter. It's school policy. Was this your mother?
Thank you for bringing him home, Mr. Rooney.
What's he doing?
You must be so excited.
If you keep this to yourself, I think we can probably get it on pretty good.
Thank you.
Well, Boyd, how are you bearing up?
Call the police. Go ahead. Better yet...
Did you see Alien? When the guy had the creature in his stomach? It feels like that.
Who's he talking to?
Shit. I hope he doesn't die. I can't handle summer school.
Hi, guys.
Is he serious?
Maybe I should call the office and tell them I won't be in.
Pardon moi.
Hello?
Thank you, Simone.
Dead grandmother.
He doesn't want me to.
I met Madonna.
It's Ferris Bueller. Nervy litttle punk. I'm gonna set a trap and let his walk right into it!
When you turn ten, your head's going to swell up real big like a watermelon and we're going to have to put you to sleep like they do with a dog.
Well, babe, today I'm the hammer.
Dad? Does my head look alright?
It's Ferris!
If it means anything to you, I have my period! MY BODY'S RIDDING ITSELF OF OLD EGGS, GODDAMN IT!
Shut-up!
Mrs. Volbeck's dead set against putting any money into the house.
ALL OUR BEST FOR A SPEEDY RECOVERY THE ENGLISH DEPT. FACULTY AND STAFF
Commodity prices rose sharply today in unusually heavy trading...
Did you get in a fight?
Like it's a beautiful woman.
Since I was three.
You looking for something in my car?
Anyway, I appreciate you letting us know how you're doing. We gotta split.
Did you see Alien?
Did you see Alien?
Drugs.
Drugs?
Excuse you. You oughta spend a little more time dealing with yourself and a little less time worrying about what your brother does. It's just an opinion.
For sure.
Garth Volbeck.
Goddamn! Are you kidding?
I meant, are you here for drugs?
Oh. He's really wasted.
So, you're pissed at him because he ditches and doesn't get caught?
That's cool. Did you shoot him or something?
Then why don't you go home?
Then your problem is you.
There's somebody you should talk to.
What do you care if your brother ditches school?
What's your name?
Yeah, I'm serious.
You could ditch.
You know him?
You never rented the video cassette?
You want to talk about your problem?
How do you watch your mouth?
I don't think it's cute. I think it's fun.
I knew he was bullshitting.
Is he going up in the space shuttle in September?
Twice.
Here.
Here.
What?
Are you guys worried about nuclear war?
Do you think the car's alright?
Maybe.
Regardless. It's with us every day. The possiblity of global destruction.
Actually, what'll happen is I'll get caught. Ferris'll escape.
Are you crazy?! Put the top back up!
Because we can't! I want it back home where it belongs!
Call me sir, goddamn it!
Don't tell me we're not going to take the car home. Please.
Enjoy it quick. It' s going home.
Ferris, let's split, please?
Ferris, my father loves this car more than life itself. We can't take is out.
Ferris? It's not working.
Food...shelter...no...yes...
Forget it. I'm putting my foot down, Ferris. You'll have to think of something else...
Gesundheit...God...mercy...
Hannibal.
He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has it tatooed on his wrist.
He never drives it, Ferris. He just rubs it with a diaper.
He'll keep calling until I come over.
Hey, Ferris? Have a nice life.
Hi. No.
How does she do that? One goes one way, one goes the other.
Howcome it's my Dad's car and I'm taking all the risk and I have to ride back here?
Huh?
I asked you first.
I changed my mind, fella. You be out in front with her! I wanna have a few words with you!
I don't feel good, Ferris. Are we gonna stay long?
I don't have to wonder. I know.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I feel better now.
I feel like complete shit, Ferris. I can't go anywhere.
I got a better idea. It's cool.
I knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us.
I know you don't care.
I said for her to be there alone and you freaked!
I think I see my Dad.
I took a stand.
I want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes. By herself. I don's want anyone around...
I was a tractor tire.
I was home, sick. You get me out of bed, being me over here, make me jeopardize my future, make me do a phoney phone call on a dean of students, a man who could squeeze my nuts into oblivion and then 
you deliberately hurt my feelings.
I'd rather not have my family break apart, thank you.
If you get a blood test today.
If you guys only had one word, what would it be?
If your blood's not compatible, you could produce a pinhead. The state requires a blood test.
I'll give you two. My mother and father.
I'm dying.
I'm gonna handle it.
I'm not doing it.
I'm sick. I feel like shit. Why can't you leave me alone?
I'm with you, babe.
It could get stolen, wrecked, scratched, you name it.
It makes me puke. Seeing people treat each other like that. It's like the car. He loves the car. He hates his wife.
It's cool. I'm loose.
It's getting late, Ferris. I have to get the car home. I know you don't care, but it means my ass.
It's hard not to.
It's help.
It's human nature to like what you had better than what you have.
It's not a piece of shit.
It's okay.
It's the only word you could ever use.
I've been thinking all day that if you could only have the use of one word, what would it be?
Just because it happens doesn't make it right. Are you comfortable with it?
Let's go...Abe.
Money...tits...please...
Music...kiss...attack...
No, thanks. I want to deal with it by myself.
No.
No. The guy who rode the elephants into Switzerland.
Nothing.
Nothing. We return the car.
Oh, really?
One hundred and twenty six and halfway between three and four tenths. Why? How many miles are on it now?
Really?
Seventeen years and I've never taken a stand. Now, I'm gonna do it. I'm taking a stand against my father, against my family, against myself, against my past, my present and my future.
I will not sit idly by as events that affect me unfold to change the course of my life. I will take a stand and I will defend it.
When my father comes home tonight, he's finally going to have to deal with me. Good or bad, I'm taking a stand.
She's not home. Where are you?
Shit...
Shredded.
So, I in other words, I should just sit back and watch it crumble?
So, you can't get married today.
So, you're saying I should run away?
Stick it up your ass, Ferris.
Stop...water...want...
Surgery...fire...move...
Thank you, Sloane.
Thanks.
That makes no sense whatsoever.
That's a pretty grim thought.
That's better.
The miles aren't coming off, running it in reverse.
The whole time I was just thinking things over. I was like, meditating.
I was thinking about the future. And I realized it doesn't make and difference if the present goes to shit.
The word is help.
They may as well be.
They're married and they hate each other.
This isn't over yet, buster. You just make sure my daughter's out in front of the school in ten minutes. Do you read me?
Very funny.
Very little.
We can't leave the car here!
We're gonna get caught. No doubt about it.
We're gonna get nabbed, for sure.
What about Rooney?
What do you think Ferris is gonna do?
What guy?
What is it?
What is this shit?
What were you in a previous life?
What'd I do?
What's spooky is they still control everything. They took over when they were young and they never gave it up.
Why'd you hit me?
Why'd you hit me?!
Why'd you hit me?!
Yeah, but to do what?
Yeah, sure. Whip it with a stick and piss on the hood.
Yeah.
Yeah. As long as I've known him, everything works for him. There's nothing he can't handle. I can't handle anything. School, parents, the future. Ferris can do anything.
Yeah. Sort of.
Yeah. Sure.
You already did it. If I need it again, I'll use it.
You could change.
You do it!
You hit me. Look, don't ask me to participate in your crap if you don't like the way I do it!
You know, this is all very interesting but I'm starving.
You need a blood test.
You oughta be sorry for Christ's sake! A family member dies and you insult me. What's the matter with you, anyway?
You're serious?
I think I see my car.
No.
...You're not talking me into this one. I have to live with the man. I'm sorry but...
I can't. I'm sick.
I don't have to try.
Oh, that's just great. Are you busted?
On second thought, I don't have time to talk to you. We'll get together soon and have lunch.
Pardon my French but you're an asshole!
You have reached the Coughlin Bros. Mortuary. We are unable to come to the phone right now but if you'll leave your name and number...
AH!
He has an incredible story.
His name is Ferris Mueller.
How did you get picked for this.
I don't know who that was or what they were playing but I apologize for it nonetheless.
Sorry about that.
A very interesting guy, Ferris Bueller.
Can you stay around and take a few phone calls?
I wish you the best of luck.
Are you also aware that Ferris does not have what we consider an exemplary attendance record?
I just had his file up.
Oh, Sloane! Dear!
As I heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney.
I have a delivery.
Gotta run.
Howdy!
Nobody's home here?
You gonna be around for awhile?
You wanna keep an eye on these?
It's very good here.
Much better here than in Russia.
One year.
You want a lift?
I NEED A TOWEL!!
IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN? SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN? TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?
Don't pay any attention to him. He thinks it's cute to bait adults.
Where's my wallet?!
I'm not very political? Let me put that into perspective...
I'm so worried about falling behind.
Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've won our freedom, we're traveling down one of American's most scenic polluted waterways and you have to bring up nuclear war?
Cameron's never been in love. At least no one's ever been in love with him. He's gonna marry the first girl he lays.
And she's gonna treat him like shit because he's gonna kiss her ass for giving him what he's built-up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existance.
She won't respect him because you can't respect someone who kisses your ass. It just doesn't work.
Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and my personal favorite, Indiana.
This is the world's tallest building. From our vantage point here on the 103 floor, we are provided with a view of four states.
We don't know when the bombs going off. We do know, however, that college starts in the fall.
...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans?
40,000 restaurants in the downtown area and I pick the one my father goes to.
A man with priorities so far out of whack doesn't deserve such a fine automobile.
A sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center for Disease Control. I don't know, man, I'm bricking heavily.
AH!
Alright, look, this is real simple.
An hour ago you wanted to yack.
And look down.
I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA GIRLS!
And what is you loathe somebody? Are you going to say "love" every time you see them?
And you thought we wouldn't have any fun. Shame on you.
Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am?
As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism?
Ask for Abe Frohman.
Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right.
Bathroom.
Be a man. Take some Pepto Bismol and get dressed. You're boring me with this stuff.
Besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheerleader with a husband, give me a good reason why not.
Better than Russia?
Bueller. Ferris Bueller.
BUY!
By the way, I borrowed some cash from you. I'll pay you back.
Cameron looks like a toddler, for Christ's sake. I'm talking about a major achievement in false identification.
CAMERON!
Cameron, are you okay? It's no problem, really. Your old man won't know a thing. It's completely fixable.
Cameron, dear friend?
Cameron, if you're not over here in fifteen minutes, you can find a new best friend. I'm serious, man.
This is bullshit, making me wait around the house for you.
Cameron, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jam you. It was uncalled for.
Cameron, the more obvious we are, the less likely we are to get caught.
Cameron, what'd you see today?
Cameron?
Cameron? Do you think this because of the car or is it a combination of everything shitty in your life?
Cameron? How many miles did you say this thing had when we left?
Cameron? It's my Dad.
Cameron? One quick question. Why'd you do that?
Cameron'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes. The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision.
The reason he doesn't fell good is, he worries about everything. He's the only guy I know who's deeply concerned that when he grows up there'll be a critical shortage of strategic metals.
Cameron's also the only guy I know who knows what strategic metals are.
Cameron's home life is really shit. He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick all the time. It really upsets him.
What he said about his parents hating each other? I refuse to sleep over at his house. His parents fight all the time. Even when I'm there.
Is there anything worse than being at somebody's house when their parents are fighting? It's the absolute height of social discomfort.
Cash.
Check, please!
Clearly you've never been to an American high school.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, BABY ON! COME ON AND WORK IT ON OUT!
Dad? Can you hold on a second?
Darling, you were wonderful.
Dead serious.
Death.
Do you love me?
Do you realize that if I played by the rules, right now I'd be in gym?
Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten.
Either would I.
Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right?
Financing my activities this way. Very damaging to the self-image. But, hey, I'm broke. In times of crisis one must to what one must to. I'll pay it back. With interest.
Frightening choice of words.
Give yourself some credit, Dad. It was a mammoth gesture. It's like those savings bonds you used to give me every Christmas.
Good?
Great. I want to you take extra special care of this vehicle, okay?
Guten tag, dude!
Have a nice day.
He doesn't trust you?
Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you?
Hello.
Hellos' generic.
He's cool. But stay away from his brother.
He's full of shit. All the old hippies are full of shit.
Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix it.
H--hell-o?
His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him.
I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.
His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her.
It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her.
Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you.
Now, the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down...
How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's going to be there with her?!
Huh?
Hurry along now!
I appreciate it.
I can't believe you'd think up something like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi right in front of you.
I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people.
I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.
I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit.
I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school?
I don't have an explanation.
I have a agree with you there.
I have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses. Could you tell me what we ordered here?
I have a test today. I have to take it. I want to get into a good college so I can have a fruitful life...
I have an idea. If you're interested.
I rest my case.
I think I broke my thumb.
I think it's a land-based beefoid creature.
I think this could work.
I thought that might be a problem. Let's crack open the odometer and roll it back by hand.
I want to.
I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign?
I was going to say I knew Springsteen's home phone number and I was going to give out the number of the New Jersey State Police but I thought I might get busted.
After I got flunked in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail box, which was not in any way, shape or from my fault.
I was putting out a cigarette, like I was told. It was weird.
I wonder if everybody shoots at cigarette butts in urinals? Probably not many women.
I'd like to cash these in, please. We're having a baby and we need the cash for a crib, clothes, diapers, food pellets, leash, water dish...
If anybody needs a day off, it's Cameron. He has alot of things to sort out before he graduates.
He can't be wound this tight and go to college. His roommate'll kill him. I've come close myself. But I like him.
He's a little easier to take when you know why he's like he is. The boy cannot relax.
Pardon by French but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you'd have a diamond.
I'll be okay. I'll just sleep. Maybe I'll have an aspirin around noon.
I'll call you tonight.
I'll do it, if you will.
I'll give the guy a five to watch it.
I'm Abe Frohman.
I'm aware of that.
I'm being tested here.
I'm game.
I'm going to tell a massive lie here. It's going to by very thick and very steamy.
I think radio's a facinating medium, it challenges the imagination. Unlike television which provides the images, radio...
I'm much better, really. Please, don't make me stay home again. I want to go to school. I'm graduating in June and I...
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!
I'm so disappointed in Cameron. Twenty bucks says he's sitting in his car debating about whether or not he should go out.
I'm taking the day off. Get dressed and come over.
Impossible. You're doing great.
In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these. The smoke tasted like glue.
Incredible! One of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second.
Is that Jeanie? I can't see that far. Jeanie?
Is there a problem?
It is his fault he didn't lock the garage.
It was risky, it was bold but it was totally necessary.
It's a piece of shit. Don't worry about it. I don't even have a piece of shit. I have to envy yours. Look, I'm sorry but there's nothing else we can do.
It's all in your head. Come on over.
It's completely cool.
It's completely cool. He's just checking up on me. Now, listen to me. I'm working on getting some heavy bucks out of him. So, the least you can do is hurry up and get over here. Bye.
It's cool.
It's kind of a long story but I've been doing alot of programming for NASA.
It's nice to know I have such loving, caring parents. You're both very special people.
It's on European socialism. I mean, really. What's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan to be European.
So, who gives a shit if they're socialists? They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car.
Just a little phlegm on the phone. Hold on.
Just out of curiosity, what was your top speed coming down the ramp?
Lean over and grab a fish.
Let's go feed Cameron.
Maybe he was actually sick. Maybe he wasn't bullshitting himself.
Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend. A parent. A child...
Maybe you're right, Dad.
Me?
Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb you at work but I was wondering if it would be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that I may need.
My best friend has flipped-out. Conventional wisdom would suggest a visit to the nearest trauma center. I wouldn't fault anybody for doing that.
My, personally, I think this calls for something new, something bold, something wet and wild.
My mother was a hippie. But she lost it. She got old. If she listens to the White Album now? She doesn't hear music, she hears memories.
Nostalgia is her favorite drug. It'll probably be mine, too. I hope not.
My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right? On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.
So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle Jeff? In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier. It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything?"
My, God, you're so stupid!
No way, Cameron. Only the meek get nabbed. The bold survive. Let's go.
No, but Kimberly's is.
No, Cameron. You wrecked a car.
No, ma'am, I'm giving it to the government. They need it. Do you know what an aircraft carrier's going for these days?
No. I'm just real loose.
No. She's saying it's time for lunch.
Not a chance in the world.
Not a glimmer.
Not that I condone fascism. Or and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an "ism". He should believe in himself.
John Lennon said it on his first solo album. "I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me." A good point there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.
Now, lean against the glass. Like this...
Nuclear spring.
Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're just trying to cheer me up.
One of the most frightening experiences of my young life has been observing my parents and our neighbors playing the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits.
It's chilling to see people crazed with the minutia of their past.
One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act.
Out in front my herself? It's too suspicious! He'll think something's up, moron. Cover it.
Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school.
Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie. Be thankful that you're fit and have your health. Cherish it.
Point well taken. But consider why she does it. Why she does it and you don't.
Regardless of how much shit sisters make you eat, how often they rat on you, how gross they act or how wicked and insensitive they can be, you should not alientate them.
Because most likely they have cash and it's usually very easy to get your hands on.
See what a finski can do to a person's attitude? He's going to treat it like a beautiful woman.
She's a person who views life as an ordeal that must be endured. Her body is a transport vehicle for her anger. I don't know where she gets this shit. Basically, the family's pretty cool.
She's probably schizophrenic.
Sloane is naked before your eyes and you're thinking about words?
Sloane's a bigger problem. She still has another year of high school. How do I deal with that?
I was serious when I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't just teenage infatuation. That's what my parents call it. What do they call what they have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation.
So, Yuri, how long have you been in America?
So...
So?
Some guy whose hair is falling out and his stomach's hanging over his belt and everything he eats makes him fart. 
He looks at someone like me and thinks, "This kid's young and strong and has a full, rich future ahead of him, what's he got to bitch about?"
Sorry, Dad. The moment before you called, I had a chest spasm and I blew lung fluid all over the place.
It was making me ill looking at it. But gee, it's sure great of you to call. I'm sure there're alot of fathers who wouldn't take time out from their busy schedules to call a dumb, sick teenager.
Splendid.
Squeeze you buns for a second. I got another call.
Stunning!
Superb.
Sure. He had to so it, I guess. His old man had it coming. He'll be okay. I'd be worried if he'd taken my idea.
Take a step back...
Talk!
Thank you.
Thanks, Jeanie.
That and boredom. Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour. Then they realize there's nothing to do. TV and food.
I myself have ditched and gotten so bored I did homework. Figure that shit out.
That hurts, Cameron.
That I care about it was.
That's just one reason why I need a day off every now and then.
The adult mind is a suspicious machine.
The question isn't "what are we gonna do", the question is "what aren't we going to do."
There's alot of pressure at work in my age group. And it's not always recognized.
They bought it.
They used to have Viet Nam. They used to have the oil crisis stuff and Iran. That's over and people have to have their big issue.
It's not like somebody came up with the nuclear holocaust yesterday at noon, you know.
This is a big U-2 fan.
This is my ninth sick day with semester. If I go for ten, I'm probably going to have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely must make this one count.
This is optomism. It's a common trait with my age group. Adults think it's cute, it's like a charming quick that infests youth.
But it's a cool thing and I think, deep down, crusty old shits wish they had some. They wish they had her, too.
This is perfect top-down weather.
This is probably the last time you'll have to ride back here. Keep that in mind.
This is really degrading.
This may very well be for real. I think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two. He's always been a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do was give him a good day.
We're gonna graduate in a couple of months. Then we have the summer. He'll work and I'll work.
And we'll see each other at night and on the weekends but then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another. And basically that'll be it.
As much as we like each other, the process of growing up will separate us.
To fix this situation, I'm going to have to ask you for a small favor.
Tomorrow?
True.
TWIST AND SHOUT!
Uh, huh. And what might that be?
Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument. Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore. He's getting one on his own. He's lost.
It's over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from school. Gone from life. His legacy is a gas station.
Upstairs, Mom!
Vaguely.
...I'm the first Chicago area youth to be selected to participate in a space shuttle mission.
Cameron! What's happening?
Have a nice day.
Have a nice day.
Home.
How do you feel?
I appreciate your conern for my well-being. It will be remembered long after...
I was trying to do some homework.
I'd really like to but I have a kidney  operation in about an hour.
I'm sorry but I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid...
I'm sorry I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid that in my weakened condition, I could take a nasty spill down the stairs and subject myself to further school absenses.
I'm sorry I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid that in my weakened condition...
I'm sorry that I can't come to the door right now...
I'm sorry to hear that. Now, come on over and pick me up.
Is your mother in the room?
My input on the Star Wars defense plan was pretty substantial so I guess this is their way of rewarding me. I'm pretty flattered.
Really? Darn! I thought I was improving.
Thank you, sir.
Thanks, Steve.
VOICE Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
You can reach my parents at their places of business. Thank you for stopping by. I appreciate your concern for my well-being. It will be remembered long after this illness has past.
You may reach my parents at their places of business.
You're not dying. You just can't think of anything good to do.
You're not up for some good times? It's a beautiful day. It's almost summer. If this was Hawaii, we'd be surfing.
We can't pick up Sloane in your car, Cameron. Rooney'd never believe Mr. Peterson drives that piece of shit.
We have enough cash left for a quick flight to Peoria and back.
WELL, SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW!
What are you doing?
What was that about?
What?!
Whatever miles we put on it, we'll take off.
What's he care about now?
What's your overall impression?
When they go after each other, Cameron tightens up. It's scary. He gets so wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns apart with a crowbar.
The thing with taking his old man's car? It's good for him. It teaches him to deal with his fear. Plus, and I must be honest here, I love driving it. I highly recommend picking one up.
Where's your brain?
Where's your brain?!
Where's your brain?!
Who is it?
Why not?
Why not?
Would I have introduced you as my wife if I didn't love you?
Would I risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if I didn't love you?
Would I trash a day of education to be with you if I didn't love you?
Would you want to get married? I mean if I wasn't an asshole.
Yeah, really.
Yeah. It was pretty cool.
Years of practice.
Yes.
Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of three for 12:00.
Yes. You?
Yo, Clouseau!
You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun.
You did screw up through, right? Not that is was necessarily all you fault. Right?
You don't have to, Dad.
You don't think it's amazing that we got in?
You feeling any better, Cameron?
You got me. I don't speak French.
You gotta get one.
You had to work hard for the money to buy those things, right?
You have to plan things out before you take the day off. Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy.
You just can't deal with anymore shit? The car took you into the red zone? Time for a reality check?
You know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part. Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. Act one was when we met. I loved you at first glance.
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue. Then came act two. You seemed to change. You acted strange. And why, I've never known.
You saw four states, a submarine, a giant heart, seventy five dollars worth of cooked pancreas, two of the most incredible breasts ever to come out of modern plastics, major league baseball and...
You speak English?
You think I don't care?
You touch me and I yell "rat!" There's another phone around here. Find it.
You trashed the car.
You want to leave? We just got here.
You want to stay home and try to have the shits? Try to barf? Try to feel worse?
You win some, you lose some.
You work so hard I'll bet you don't even remember where those bonds are, right?
You're father's a toad and your Mom's always wired out, but so what? They're old. That's natural.
It's kind of like being in the belly of the beast isn't it?
Everybody thinks you're an asshole.
I didn't mean it that way.
I don't know. Just forget it.
I don't think you're an asshole.
I think he's cute.
Maybe if you didn't cat like and asshole...
Not everybody thinks you're an asshole. Mr. Rooney likes you.
Somebody who threatens to sock people's tits has a problem.
Take a walk, Jeanie.
Why? What's the point?
You really do have a problem, Jeanie.
A whole bunch of people. They said he's like on the verge of death.
Gummi Bear?
Hello?
I'll bet you never smelled a real school bus before.
I'm really sorry about your brother.
No, I mean I heard he's really sick.
They've been in pocket. They're real soft and warm.
This guy in my biology class said that if Ferris dies he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's really sweet isn't he?
Yeah, why?
SHAKE IT UP, BABY
TWIST AND SHOUT!
Here.
Here.
He's sick.
WORK IT ON OUT!
Cubs.
Zero to zero.
Oh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?
Yeah, right. Dry that one out and you can fertilize the lawn.
Ferris Bueller's days are numbered.
Alright. How about if I sock your face?
Alright. If you've got the time, I've got the troubles. In a nutshell, I hate my brother. How's that?
Am I acting like an asshole?
Basically.
Blow yourself.
Can you imagine someone as sick as Ferris trying to walk home from the hospital?
Do you know a guy named Garth Volbeck?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Forget that everybody thinks I'm an asshole? Would you like everybody to think you're an asshole?
Go piss up a flagpole!
He's gone. He's over. He's monkey meat.
Hi.
I can't believe my brother's making me put myself in a position where I could get expelled. Selfish little moron.
I don't know why I'm here.
I knew it!
I this a conspiracy to shit all over me or something? Is my brother behind this? Tell me if he is or I'll sock your tits.
I went home to confirm that the shithead was ditching school and a guy broke into the house and I called the cops and they picked me up for making a phoney phone call.
I'd get caught.
If you say Ferris Bueller, you lose a testicle.
I'm gonna microwave his nuts...
I'm saved! Thank you, God! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I'm sorry I've been riding your buns for so long.
Is Dean Rooney in?
Is he cool?
Is Mrs. Bueller there? Where is she? This is her daughter. Do you know where she is? Do you know when she'll be back? Do you know anything?
It's real nice that you hope my brother's feeling better but I'm in danger, okay? I'm very cute, I'm very alone and I'm very protective of my body. I'd rather not have it violated or killed. I need 
help!
It's reprehensible to squeal on your own flesh and blood...but it's for his own good. His cavalier attitude will get him into trouble later in life...
and it'll continue to piss me off and I'll get so wadded-up that it'll cause cervex cancer and he'll ruin my life. Screw him.
Jean. What's yours?
Let me tell you something. I study hard, I work hard, I'm polite, I'm considerate, I'm friendly and fair to all kinds of people. Except morons.
I try to be everything a good, decent person should be and you know what?
Me? I have a problem?
No problem.
No, not yet.
No, thank you. I'm straight.
Oh, hey. That's exciting. A fat fifty year old clod with B.O. likes me.
OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!!
Pucker up and squat, Ferris.
Rachel?
Rachel's a dirt bag. Who else?
See? My brother strokes you, you sympathize with him, I get pissed off and this is what happens!
Sweetie, it's an established fact that you have no taste. Ferris is not cute. He's not charming. He's not nice. He's not a wonderful person.
He's an ignorant mule and the sooner everybody in this school comes to that realization the better off we'll all be.
Thank God, you're alright! We've been worried sick!
Thank...you...
The worm has luck like clams have body odor...
This is not a phoeny phone call. There's an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed, certainly weird, in our kitchen.
What're you sorry for? I have to live with the trouser snake.
Who does?
WHO PISSED ON THE TOILET SEAT!? MOTHER!!
Who said he's sick.
Why are you here?
Why don't you put your thumb up your butt?
Why should he get to ditch school when everybody else has to go?
Why? Because I'm sick of the little dope. He manipulates my parents, he does whatever he wants, whenever he wants and he never gets nailed.
With you? Are you serious?
Would everybody be happier if maybe I were to die in a flaming car accident or something?
You don't have to.
You don't have to. I've been ripping off your wallet for years.
You really want to know what's wrong?
You're not falling for this, are you? Tell me you're not falling for this.
Excuse me. If whoever's in the house is still in the house, I'd like you to know that I have just called the police. If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll get your ass out of my house real quick.
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun. And a scorching case of herpes.
Ferris!
We love you, sweetie.
Did I tell you I have a son your age?
Do you know my son?
Don't "hi" me, young lady. Get your stuff.
Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.
Get downstairs! Now!
Get downstairs! NOW!
Get your stuff. Daddy'll be right down.
He doesn't feel well.
He doesn't have a fever. But he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.
His name is Ferris. I think you'd like him.
Honey?
How did you get so sweet?
I can give you every assurance that Ferris is home and that he is, in fact, very ill. I debated whether or not I should even leave him.
I can appreciate that at this time of year children are prone to taking the day off, but in Ferris' case, he's truly a very sick boy.
I hope so. I appreciate your calling me. I can assure you that her father and I will have a long talk with her.
I hope you feel better, pumpkin.
If you're willing to commit a little time and a little money to this place, you can really have something to be proud of. Don't let the black living room throw you off.
Joyce Bueller.
Mrs. Froeling, how are you?
My son's home sick today. If you wouldn't mind, on our way back to the office, I'd like to just run in and check up on him.
No one's going to consider a house with a black living room. Not even those jerks from Vermont. Let's be realistic.
Not that I know of.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot to call.
She's never been in trouble before. This is a shock to me. First, I don't know why she wasn't at school. Second, I don't know why she'd call you with this story about a rapist.
Thank you.
You're not going to school like this.
I don't understand.
Nine times?
This is all news to me.
Yes, I am. Ferris is home sick. I had a meeting first thing this morning. I should have called. It completely slipped my mind.
Heartless wench...
Hey, babe! Some day you might need a favor from Ferris Bueller! Then where'll you be?!
Hey, Mr. Rooney! What're you doing?
Huh?
They run about fifty g's so it you could help out...
Yo. We're collecting money to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney.
A WATERMELON!
If he dies, I got dibs on his stereo.
Is my head swelling up?
Myocardial infarction?
Oh, shit!
Syphilitic meningitus? That would be a huge family embarrassment.
WaitHold still!
KIMBERLY You heads starting to swell up!!
TO YOUR LEFT IT THE WORLD'S TALLEST BUILDING...
Enjoy your luncheon.
I appreciate your understanding.
Shall I call the police?
You're Abe Frohman?
Are you aware that your son is not in school today?
Ed? This is George Peterson.
We've had a bit of bad luck this morning as you may have heard.
Of course.
Watch your mouth.
I passed a kidney stone Tuesday.
She told me everything. Keep me posted, I'll want to send a gift.
TWIST A LITTLE CLOSER!
May I see you outside for a moment? There's been an emergency.
Sloane Peterson?
For whatever reasons she did it, I think she'd had a good scare.
Oh, by the way, I hope you son's feeling better.
Tell him, all the guys at the station here are pulling for him.
AHHHHH!
YOU KNOW YOU LOOK SO GOOD!
AH!
LOOK SO GOOD!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Your ass is mine.
Absolutely! I most certainly am.
And I'm going to stop it!
B.S. Come down here.
Could you get me Mr. Peterson's daytime number?
Dead grandmother?
Don't get smart with me Ferris!
Ed Rooney.
Ferris Bueller's behind this. There's no doubt in my mind. That's what I was saying this morning. Why he has to be stopped. He's got Sloane Peterson involved in this thing now. See?
How are you today, sir?
How does another year of high school sit with you?
I don't know. I thought you were someone else. You have to know, sir, that I would never deliberately insult you. I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am.
I don't trust this kid any further than I can throw him!
I got you, Ferris. This time I finally got you.
I have it right here in front of me. He's missed...
I heard. And, gosh, I'm all broken up. Huh? Oh, sure. I'd be happy to release Sloane. You produce a corpse and I'll release Sloane. I want to see this dead grandmother firsthand.
I imagine so.
I just has his file up, Mrs. Bueller.
If Ferris thinks he coast this last month and still graduate, he's sorely mistaken.
I'll tell you want, you don't like my policies, you can just come on down and smooch by big old ugly ass. You hear me?
I'm not leaving until you come down and talk to me.
I'm not leaving, Ferris.
Looking for this?
No.
Once again let me say how deeply saddened I am by your loss.
Really?
Sleep tight, pooch.
Something's going on, goddamn it.
That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you worthless mutt!
That's exactly why I have to catch him this time. To show these kids that the example he sets is a first class ticket to nowhere.
This is Ed Rooney, Ferris. I'd like to have a word with you.
Were you close to your grandmother?
What!?
What?
What's so dangerous about a character like Ferris Bueller is that he gives the good kids bad ideas.
The last thing I need at this point in my career is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls.
What's the score?
Who gives a good goddamn?
Who's this girl's going with?
Who's winning?
Load and clear, Mr. Peterson.
Sir.
So far this semester alone, he's been absent nine times. Including today.
Ferris Bueller. You know him?
No.
What?
And her grandmother, too.
Do you still want his number?
Ed Rooney's office.
Edward Rooney's office.
Ferris Bueller's on line two.
Hello, Jeanie. Who's bothering you now?
He's very popular, Ed. Sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, pinheads, dweebies, wonkers, richies, they all adore him.
Hold, please.
I don't know. He left the grounds on personal business.
I'm sorry, he's out. Can I help you?
It's Mr. Peterson.
It's so hard to tell. I see her alot with Ferris Bueller.
My brother-in-law rides the train to work.
My brother-in-law'll appreciate it.
That's what Mr. Peterson said. I had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane.
There's a railroad strike.
This is the Peterson's home.
Watch your mouth this time.
With your bad knee, you better not throw anybody, Ed.
YOU IDIOT!!
Dad? All this talking has made me kind of light-headed. I think I better lie down.
Don't you think it's an issue because people need something to worry about? They have to like, have some major problem that puts all their little bullshit into some kind of persepective?
It is kind of raggy subject, Cam.
To answer your question...No, I'm not worried about it at all.
Yeah. Everybody's dead, it's real cold and the skiing's for shit.
A girl can always bail out and have a baby and get some guy to support her.
Actually, we're hoping for a car.
Agreed.
Baldness, fatty meats and money.
Cameron! Cut it out! What's wrong?! Ferris!
Cameron? I could flip real easy, too. There's nothing wrong with it. At one time or another, everybody goes to the zoo.
Cameron's right. We're gonna get busted.
Can we leave now?
College.
Come on, Ferris, answer his question.
Consider this...my father canned me and my brother and my Mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits. He dropped us like a rock.
Everything was cool at our house. I thought so. We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over.
Cool.
Do they like you?
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Do you believe that you lived before?
DO you ever wonder what you were?
Do you love me?
Do you think they're staying together because of you?
Ferris, this is nauseating me. Really. I'm losing respect for you by the bucket.
Ferris?
From the A-Team?
God bless you, Cameron.
He says I don't care about things like he did.
He's gonna marry me. I know it.
Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?
Huh?
I asked you first.
I could see him ignoring popular belief and taking off on some impossible mission.
I don't know. But it looks like it's already been eaten and digested.
I guess that's my Dad. Thanks. See ya.
I had a great time today.
I love him.
I LOVE YOU!
I think if he was anybody, he was Magellan. You know, the guy who went around the world.
I'd say...
I'm not a tramp.
I'm not getting married.
I'm not interested in watching someone jiggle their mammary glands.
I'm not sure but I think I know who Ferris was.
I'm thrilled, ma'am. I'm especially looking forward to wearing those jeans with the stretch panel in front.
It's better than "hello".
Jump back, Ferris, Cameron's been a good sport.
Love.
Me either.
My parents are divorced. So what? It's not like it doesn't happen ten thousand times a day.
My step-father's always going off about how when he was young he was committed to all these causes.
No way!
No wonder you're always sick.
No. It's not something I can get comfortable with. I've tried. Are yours divorced?
Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher.
Oh, please, Cameron. Do you have to be so graphic?
Oh, shit!
Oh. Um. Yeah. Very. She was a terrific lady. Very hip. Very old. Yeah.
Sloane Peterson
Really.
Roast!
Shut-up! It is a problem! For him it's a problem. Nothing's a problem for you. But it's a problem for him! So, just shut-up.
Sure.
The future's worse for a boy, isn't it?
The water's really nice. I wish you'd come in.
They call the shots. When you split from them, you call the shots.
This has to be a dream.
This is so great! I can't believe it! Right in front of Rooney!
This is so right!
True, but it's an option. No options is worse.
Wait a minute. That was a lie.
We can't come to the phone right now. We've had a death in the family. If you need to reach us we'll be at the following number...
We could go to my house. My parents aren't coming home until late.
Well, you know what? It ain't up to you. It's out of your hands.
What a fabulous car!
What about your one word?
What are you interested in?
What can I do, Cameron?
What comes after a nuclear winter?
What could happen to it?
What do you mean, why not? Think about it.
What if the glass gives?
What?
What?
What?
What're we gonna do?
What's next.
What's so funny?
Who wants to get in?
Why?
Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to. I'm gonna think about it. I'm gonna try to prevent it.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You didn't have an idea, did you?
You got a call, you broke your thumb, what's left to do?
You okay?
You think Cameron's gonna be alright?
You wanna be generic?
You're merely an inhabitant in their universe.
You're so smart.
The Sears Tower.
KNOW THAT YOU'RE MINE!
Roosevelt's health had seriously deteriorated by the time he met with Churchill and Stalin at Yalta.
Albers?
Anderson.
Anheiser?
Bueller?
Bueller?
Busch?
Drucker?
COME ON AND TWIST A LITTLE CLOSER!
A baby!
Are you hoping for a boy or a girl?
Ferris Bueller?
I passed a kidney stone Tuesday, so I'm a little pooped but other than that, I'm as chipper as can be.
These bonds aren't mature. If you hold onto them another two years you'll get an additional four dollars...
You're throwing away four dollars.
Ferris?  Does my head look like it's getting bigger?
I think so.
Is my head going to swell up?
Just answer me one question! Is it swelling up? Kim said it was going to get as big as...
MOM!
SHUT-UP!
What?!
What's that?
Call if you need us.
Ferris? How do you feel?
Ferris. You're sick. There's no point pushing yourself and making it worse.
Ferris?
Get downstairs!
Get some rest.
I know I'm right.
I'll check it with you, too.
JOYCE!
JOYCE!!
That's enough, Jeanie.
Were you sleeping?
What?
What?!
What's the matter, Ferris?
What's wrong?
Where's Mom?
Why don't you want Mom to call the doctor?
You sound miserable.
Ferris?
Hey, pal, what was I supposed to do?
I want to. Bye now.
Like hell I am. They're in a shoebox in my closet.
Not any harder than anybody else.
Okay, pal. You take care. I'll call you after lunch.
Sure, pal. Are you alright?
Wrong.
MOM!
AH!
Anybody home?

Pancreas.
Sweetbreads.
YOU KNOW YOU LOOK SO FINE!
EOP
