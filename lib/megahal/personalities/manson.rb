I don't deserve a chance to be
He is the angel with the scabbed wings
Hard-drug face, want to powder his nose
He will deflower the freshest crop
Dry up all the wombs with his rock and roll sores
Dead
Is what he is, he does what he please
The things that he has you'll never want to see
What you're never gonna be now
Sketch a little keyhole for looking-glass people
You don't want to be him
You only want to see him
Mommy's got a scarecrow, gotta let the corn grow
Man can't always reap what he sow
He is the maker
He is the taker
He is the Saviour
You built me up with your wishing hell
I didn't have to sell you
You threw your money in the pissing well
You do just what they tell you
REPENT, that's what I'm talking about
I shed the skin to feed the fake
Whose mistake am I anyway?
Cut the head off, and it grows back hard
I am the hydra
Now you'll see your star
The time has come for bitter things
The time has come it is quite clear
Our antichrist is almost here...
Each time I make my mother cry and angel dies and falls from Heaven
When the boy is still a worm it's hard to learn the number seven
But when they get to you
It's the first thing that they do
Each time I look outside my mother dies,
I feel my back is changing shape
When the worm consumes the boy it's never considered rape
When they get to you
Prick you finger it is done...
The moon has now eclipsed the sun...
The angel has spread his wings...
When you wish upon your star
Don't let yourself fall, fall into too hard
I fell into you and I'm on my back
An insect decaying in your little trap
I squirm into you, now I'm in your gut
I fell into you, now I'm in a rut
I lift you up liekt he sweetest angel,
I'll tear you down, like a whore,
I will bury your God in my warm spit
You'll be deformed in your porn
Rock star yeah 
You eat up my heart and all the little parts
Your star is so sharp
It leaves my jagged holes
I make myself sick just to poison you
If I can't have you then no one will
You cut off all of your fingers
Trade them in for dollar bills
Cake on some more make-up to cover all of those lines
Wake up and stop shaking cause you're just wasting time
Don't you want some of this?
Don't you need some of this?
You take what can't be given
You ride what cannot be ridden
Pinch this tiny heart of mine, wrap it up in soiled twine
You never read what you've written
I'll be your lover, I'll be forever
I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when I'm high
You shove your hair down my throat
I feel your fingers in me
Tear this bitter fruit to mess
And wrap it in your soiled dress
Now you must spit out the seeds
All dried up and tied up forever
I am so all-American, I'd sell you suicide
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the animal who whill not be himself
FUCK IT!
Hey victim, should I black your eyes again?
Hey victim,
You were the one who put the stick in my hand.
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
Let's just kill everyone and let your God sort them out
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side
I better, better, better, better not say this
Better, better, better, better, not tell
I am the idiot who will not be himself
He lives inside my mouth
And tells me what to say
When he turns the trains
On he makes it go away
The hands are cracked and dirty and the nails are beetle wings
When he turns the trains on he unties all the strings
Tell me something beautiful, tell me something free, tell me something beautiful, and I wish that I could be.
The toys all smell like children
And scab-knees will obey
I'll have to kneel on broomsticks
Just to make it go away.
The inauguration of the worm
Then I got my wings and I never even know it
When I was a worm, thought I couldn't get through it
A voice we have not yet heard 
Because today Is black because the is not turning back.
Because your lies have watered me I have become the Strongest weed
Through Jack's eyes
Dinstegrator
Three holes upon the leather belt
It's cut and swollen
And the age is showing
There's no one here to save ourself.
This is what you should fear
You are what you should fear
There's an apple in the pussy mouth
Now I am the dinner whore
There's a tumor in the T.V. mouth
Burn it out before it grows
Someone better get the dog to kick, jaws wired shut to save the dick
Out of the bottomless pit comes the little horn
Little horn is born
The world spreads its legs for another star...
The world shows its face for another scar.
The dead will dance for what is left.
The worms will wait with bated breath.
"Your blind have now become my deaf," so says the little horn...
Save yourself from this...
Everyone will suffer now...
You can't save yourself...
We're on the other side, the screen is us and we're T.V.
Spread me open, sticking to my pointy ribs are all your infants in abortion cribs.
Pray until you're numb, asleep from all
Your pain, your apple has been rotting.
Tomorrow's turned up dead.
I have it all and I no choice but to make everyone pay and you will see.
You can kill yourself now because you're dead in my mind.
The boy that you loved is the monster you fear.
I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape
Pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed.
Someone had to go this far.
I was born into this.
Everything turns to shit.
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear!
Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark, you've poisoned all your children to camouflage your scars.
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear...
Pray your life was just a dream, the cut that never heals.
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream.
The world in my hands, there's no one left to hear you scream.
There's not one left for you .
There's not much left to love.
Too tired today to hate.
I feel the empty.
I feel the minute of decay.
The minute that it's born it begins to die.
I'd love to just give in.
I've been to black and back.
I've whited out my name.
A lack of pain, a lack of hope, a lack of anything to say.
There is no cure for what is killing me.
I'm on my way down.
I've looked ahead and saw a world that's dead.
I guess that I am too on my way down, I'd like to take you with me...
I'll do anything for you.
I'm you're number one fan.
Hey Mr. Porno star, I, I, I, I want you.
Hey, Mr. Sickly star, I want to get sick from you.
Hey Mr. Fallen star, don't you know I worship you?
Hey Mr. Big rock star, I wanna grow up just like you.
Hey Mr. Superhate, I just want to love you.
I wanna go down on you.
Hey Mr. Supergod, will you answer my prayers?
I want to be your little girl.
I know that I can turn you on.
I wish I could just turn you off.
I never wanted this.
I'll kill myself for you.
Hey Mr. Superstar, I'll kill you if I can't have you.
Superstar, superfuck baby...
And I don't want you and I don't need you.
Don't bother to resist, or I'll beat you.
It's not your fault that you're always wrong.
The weak ones are there to justify the strong.
The beautiful people, the beautiful people, it's all relative to the size of your steeple.
You can't see the forest for the trees, and you can't smell your own shit on your knees.
The worms will live in every host.
It's hard to pick which one they eat the most.
The horrible people, the horrible people.
It's all anatomic as the size of your steeple.
Capitalism has made it this way, old-fashioned facism will take it away.
Hey you, what do you see?
Something beautiful, something free?
Hey you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean...
There's no time to discriminate; hate every motherfucker that's in your way!
You world is an ashtray; we burn and coil like cigarettes...
The more you cry, your ashes turn to mud.
Its the nature of the leeches, the virgin's feeling cheated.
You've only spent a second of your life.
I went to god just to see, and I was looking at me!
Saw Heaven and hell where it lies.
When I'm God, everyone dies.
Scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller.
Can you feel my power?
One shot and the world gets smaller.
Let's jump upon the sharp swords and cut away our smiles.
Without the threat of death, there's not reason to live at all.
My world is unaffected, there is no exit here.
I say it is and then it's true.
There is a dream inside a dream.
I'm wide awake the more I sleep.
You'll understand when I'm dead.
Each thing I show you is a piece of my death.
Shoot shoot shoot motherfucker
No salvation... No forgiveness...
Forgiveness!
She's made of hair and bone and little teeth and things I cannot speak...
She comes on like a crippled plaything, spine is just a string.
I wrapped our love in all this foil, silver-tight like spider legs.
I never wanted it to ever spoil but flies will always lay their eggs.
I am your tourniquet.
Prosthetic synthesis with butterfly, sealed up with virgin stitch.
If it hurts, just tell me.
Preserve the innocent...
I never wanted it to end like this but flies will lay their eggs.
Take your hatred out on me.
Make your victim my head!
You never ever believed in me.
Go ahead and kill a dead messiah, we can dig another grave.
This is your calling.
If you are hearing this there is nothing I can do.
Something has grown out of my chest.
And I have seen it.
It is hard and cold.
It has been dormant for many years.
We are trying to save you and I have come to save you.
This is what you deserve, this is what we deserve.
This is something we have brought upon ourselves.
We are not a victim, you are not a victim.
God will grovel before me.
God will crawl at my feet.
And the time is this.
And the time is...
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you.
When will you realize you're already there?
So watered down, your feelings have turned to mud.
"Love everybody" is destroying the value of all hate.
I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping away...
Oh no, it is everything they said it was...
Oh no, I am all the things they said I was...
When you get to Heaven, you will wish you're in hell!
When will you realize, you're already here?
You'll thank us now that you have crossed over.
Don't pick the scabs or you will never heal.
The world shudders as the worm gets his wings.
