I am a human being.
I am the president of the United States.
I am not a sexual offendor.
I'm here to do the American peoples work.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
Sexual relations means intercourse, plain and simple.
The prosecution coined that definition, not me.
In Mississippi a man can legally marry a 13 year old?  That's why it's called _Miss_issippi.
The whole truth means just that.
That depends on what the definition of the word _is_ is.
The American people know that I'm a nice guy.
She was there, (bites lip) but not _there_.
(Squint)
I believe my attorney already answered that question (squint).
That was submitted in a press release last week, I believe you will find your answer there.
I don't believe it would be proper for me to discuss that at this time.
Hahaha!  That's a good one! (biting lip)
Ha! Ho! (biting lip)
Heh heh (biting lip)
Now that's a good one! (biting lip)
(bites lip)
Hah hah!
No, I don't believe you have your facts right.
Look, I've already discussed this in detail.
That is hypothetical.
I don't want to get into a rhetorical argument.
I did not.
Let's be honest.
I would like to work with the Republicans on a non-partisan basis.
I answered that already.
No.
Okay, next question please.
Ok, next question please.
No, I did not.
Yes, I was not there.

I don't know exactly what was written there, but I don't think you have your facts right.
Hmmm. (biting lip)
Damn Republicans.
I did not.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
I cannot talk about that at this time.
Please discuss that with my attorney, he will be happy to answer your questions.
What exactly are you talking about?
Which lips?
That's just more Republican rhetoric.
Is that the best question you could come up with?
I don't know, but I would be happy to find out and discuss that with you later.
No. Next question please.

Biting lips is the purest form of expression.
Don't you bite your lips?
I like lips.
Red lips are the best.
Young is good, old is my wife.
Monica is a babe (biting lip).
Brunettes are my favorite.
I like women with big hair.
Dark hair is good, but blonde is also good, (bites lip) hell all big hair is good.
My wife never knew.

In the beginning God created women and me.

The Chinese stole nuclear technology during the Reagan years, not during mine.
The Chinese believe that we have to have an enemy.
As long as the Chinese believe that we have to have an enemy, they will continue to build up their military.
I have no desire to nuke the Republicans.
Bomb the hell out of them.
Talk about stealth bombers.
