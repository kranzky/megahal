I am sorry that I am not at London, to be at Hide-parke to-morrow, among the great gallants and ladies, which will be very fine.
No other extraordinary rencontre, but my hat falling off my head at Newington into the water, by which it was spoiled, and I ashamed of it.
We got a small bait at Leatherhead, and so to Godlyman
Through her mask Mr. Hater’s wife seemed at first to be an old woman, but afterwards I found her to be a very pretty modest black woman.
My wife and I and Mr. Creed took coach, and in Fishstreet took up Mr. Hater and his wife.
Home and to bed, where my wife had not lain a great while.
By Sir W. Batten’s and Sir W. Pen’s persuasion I sent for my wife from my father’s, who came to us, where we were all at a collacion.
Home again, and gave order to my workmen what to do in my absence.
To the office, where it is determined that I should go to-morrow to Portsmouth.
Lieut. Lambert is troubled about being offered a fourth rate ship to be Lieutenant of now he has been two years Lieutenant in a first rate.
My father bid me to take notice of it to my mother, and to make peace between him and her. All which do trouble me very much.
The wench was the most ill-favoured slut that I saw in my life, which I was ashamed to hear that my mother should be become such a fool.
My father told me my mother would not let him come to bed to her out of jealousy of him and an ugly wench that lived there lately.
Home by coach to Sir W. Batten’s, who seems so inquisitive when my, house will be made an end of that I am troubled to go thither.
Dined with my Lady, and after dinner with Mr. Creed and Captain Ferrers to the Theatre to see “The Chances.”
Having some thoughts to order my business so as to go to Portsmouth the next week with Sir Robert Slingsby.
At the office all the morning, and dined by myself at home on a piece of meat from the cook’s.
Mr. Moore and I went to an Ordinary at the King’s Head in Towre Street, and there had a dirty dinner.
All the morning with my workmen with great pleasure to see them near coming to an end.
So to bed.
I hear the noise of the chambers, and other things of the fire-works, which are now playing upon the Thames before the King.
After dinner home, and advised with my wife about ordering things in my house, and then she went away to my father’s to lie.
My wife and I went to dinner to Sir W. Batten, and all our talk about the happy conclusion of these last solemnities.
I rose and went out with Mr. Creed to drink our morning draft, which he did give me in chocolate to settle my stomach.
When I waked I found myself wet with my spewing.
No sooner a-bed with Mr. Shepley but my head began to hum, and I to vomit, and if ever I was foxed it was now.
Thus did the day end with joy every where; and blessed be God, I have not heard of any mischance to any body through it all.
We drank the King’s health, and nothing else, till one of the gentlemen fell down stark drunk, and there lay spewing.
We thought a strange frolique; but these gallants continued thus a great while, and I wondered to see how the ladies did tipple.
Many great gallants laid hold of us, and would have us drink the King’s health upon our knees, which we all did, they drinking to us.
I took my wife and Mrs. Frankleyn to Axe-yard, in which at the further end there were three great bonfires.
But the fire-works were not performed to-night: only the City had a light like a glory round about it with bonfires.
At Mr. Bowyer’s we staid upon the leads and below, expecting to see the fire-works.
Then it fell a-raining and thundering and lightening: which people did take great notice of; God’s blessing of the work of these two days.
Strange it is to think, that these two days have held up fair till now that all is done, and the King gone out of the Hall.
I took a great deal of pleasure to go up and down, and look upon the ladies, and to hear the musique, but above all, the 24 violins.
At the Lords’ table, I met with William Howe, and he spoke to my Lord for me, and he did give me four rabbits and a pullet.
The King drinks to the Champion, and sends him the cup which is of gold, and he drinks it off, and then rides back with the cup in his hand.
A Herald proclaims “That if any dare deny Charles Stewart to be lawful King of England, here was a Champion that would fight with him.”
Above all was Lords Northumberland and Suffolk, and the Duke of Ormond, coming before the courses on horseback, and staying all dinner-time.
Many fine ceremonies there was of the Heralds leading up people before him, and bowing.
The King’s first course carried up by the Knights of the Bath.
The King came in with his crown on, and his sceptre in his hand, under a canopy borne up by six silver staves, carried by Barons.
Into the Hall I got, where it was very fine with scaffolds one upon another full of brave ladies; and my wife in one, on the right hand.
But I had so great a lust to pisse that I went out a little while before the King had done all his ceremonies.
So great a noise that I could make but little of the musique; and indeed, it was lost to every body.
A Generall Pardon was read by the Lord Chancellor. Meddalls flung up and down by my Lord Cornwallis, of silver, but I could not come by any.
The King at Arms proclaimed, that if any one could show any reason why Charles Stewart should not be King of England, that he should speak.
Taking the oath, and having things read to him by the Bishop; and his lords and bishops come, and kneeled before him.
To my great grief I and most in the Abbey could not the ceremonies.
Then the Duke, and the King with a scepter (carried by my Lord Sandwich) and sword and mond before him, and the crown too.
All the officers of all kinds, so much as the very fidlers, in red vests.
A great pleasure it was to see the Abbey raised in the middle, all covered with red, and a throne and footstool on the top of it.
I did get up into a scaffold across the North end of the Abbey, where with patience I sat from past 4 till 11 before the King came in.
I rose and got to the Abbey, where I followed Sir J. Denham, the Surveyor, with some company that he was leading in.
My Lord talked with me about his suit, which was made in France, and cost him 200l, and very rich it is with embroidery.
Will and the boy staid and saw the show upon Towre Hill, and Jane at T. Pepys’s, and my wife at Charles Glassecocke’s, in Fleet Street.
Sir W. Batten and I drunk some mum and laid our wager about my Lady Faulconbridge’s name, which he says not to be Mary. I won above 20s.
The show being ended, Mr. Young did give us a dinner, at which we were very merry, and pleased above imagination at what we have seen.
It is impossible to relate the glory of this day, expressed in the clothes of them that rid, and their horses and horses clothes.
Both the King and the Duke of York took notice of us, as he saw us at the window.
So glorious was the show with gold and silver, that we were not able to look at it, our eyes at last being so much overcome with it.
The ladies out of the windows, one of which over against us I took much notice of, and spoke of her, which made good sport among us.
The streets all gravelled, and the houses hung with carpets before them, made brave show.
There followed the Vice-Chamberlain, Sir G. Carteret, a company of men all like Turks; but I know not yet what they are for.
Wadlow, the vintner, at the Devil; in Fleetstreet, did lead a fine company of soldiers, all young comely men, in white doublets.
The King, in a most rich embroidered suit and cloak, looked most noble.
My Lord Monk rode bare after the King, and led in his hand a spare horse, as being Master of the Horse.
The Bishops come next after Barons, which is the higher place.
The Knights of the Bath was a brave sight of itself; and their Esquires, among which Mr. Armiger was an Esquire to one of the Knights.
There we had a good room to ourselves, with wine and good cake.
Sir W. Batten, my Lady, and his two daughters and his son and wife, and Sir W. Pen and his son and I, went to Mr. Young’s, in Corne-hill.
Up early and made myself as fine as I could, and put on my velvet coat, the first day that I put it on.
My mind troubled about my workmen, which, being foreigners, are like to be troubled by lazy rogues that worked with me, that are citizens.
So home, people being at church, and I got home unseen, and so up to my chamber and saw done these last five or six days’ diarys.
I went home, and all the way is so thronged with people to see the triumphal arches, that I could hardly pass for them.
Here dined Dr Thos. Pepys and Dr. Fayrebrother; and all our talk about to-morrow’s show, and our trouble that it is like to be a wet day.
To my father’s and there found the late maid to be gone and another come by my mother’s choice, which my father do not like.
We were troubled to hear it rain as it did, because of the great show tomorrow.
The ways being now so dirty, and stopped up with the rayles which are this day set up in the streets, I would not go home.
And so many great beauties, but above all Mrs. Palmer, with whom the King do discover a great deal of familiarity.
Saw “The Humersome Lieutenant” acted before the King, but not very well done. But my pleasure was great to see the manner of it.
With Mr. Creed to the Exchange and bought some things, as gloves and bandstrings, &amp;c.
I carried my Lady back, and I found my Lord angry, for that his page had let my Lord’s new beaver be changed for an old hat.
To White Hall; in the Banqueting-house saw the King create my Lord Chancellor and several others, Earls, and Mr. Crew and others, Barons.
my Lord looked upon his pages’ and footmen’s liverys, which are come home to-day, and will be handsome, though not gaudy.
After the Duke had told us that the fleet was designed for Algier, we did advise about many things as to the fitting of the fleet.
The Duke sent us to his closett where we saw two chests covered with gold and Indian varnish, given him by the East Indy Company of Holland.
We went up and saw the Duke dress himself, and in his night habitt he is a very plain man.
I went by water to Mr. Coventry’s, and there staid and talked a good while with him till all the rest of the principal officers come.
Here comes my boy to tell me that the Duke of York had sent for all the principal officers, &amp;c., to come to him to-day.
Home, and having staid awhile till Will came in (with whom I was vexed for staying abroad) he comes and then I went by water to my father’s.
It being so foul that I could not go to Whitehall to see the Knights of the Bath made to-day, which do trouble me mightily.
They giving him some high words, Sir W. Pen went back again and struck them off their horse, in a simple fury, and without much honour.
We met two country fellows upon one horse but Sir W. Pen would not give way, but struck them and they him, and so passed away.
After dinner we all went to the Church stile, and there eat and drank, and I was as merry as I could counterfeit myself to be.
My Lady was in a bad mood, which we were troubled at. Had she been noble she would not have been so with her servants, when we came thither.
Up with my workmen and then took horse with both the Sir Williams for Walthamstow, and there we found my Lady and her daughters all.
Here we had great talk of Mr. Warren’s being knighted by the King, and Sir W. B. seemed to be very much incensed against him.

I went to dinner with Sir W. Batten, and then home to my workmen, and saw them go on with great content to me.
I saw the picture of the ships and other things this morning, set up before the East Indy House, which are well done.
By land and saw the arches, which are now almost done and are very fine.
In came the two Sir Wms, and so we sat down and did a great deal of public business about the fitting of the fleet that is now going out.
We put off for Deptford, where we went on board the King’s pleasure boat that Commr. Pett is making, and indeed it will be a pretty thing.
Word was brought me that Mr. Coventry was come with the barge to the Tower. I went to him and found him reading of the Psalms in short hand.
So home and sent for the Barber, and after that to bed.
I had a little talk with my uncle Wight what good I might make of these ships that go to Portugal by venturing some money by them.
Sir R. Slingsby's lady seems a good woman and very desirous they were to hear this noon by the post how the election has gone at Newcastle.
I went to the office and there met Mr. Coventry and Sir Robt. Slingsby, but did no business.
My wife, poor wretch, followed me as far in the rain and dark as Fleet Bridge to fetch me back again, and so I did.
To my father’s, and after supper seemed willing to go home, and my wife seeming to be so too I went away in a discontent.
Mr. Moore shewed me a copy of my Lord Chancellor’s patent for Earl, and I read the preamble, which is very short, modest, and good.
I heard Mr. Jacomb, upon these words, “Christ loved you and therefore let us love one another,” and made a lazy sermon, like a Presbyterian.
With Sir W. Pen and Capt. Terne to the buriall of Capt. Blake. There had each of us a ring, but it being dirty, we would not go to church.
I saw the King heal, the first time that I saw him do it; which he did with great gravity. It seemed to be an ugly office and a simple one.
By water from Towre-wharf. We could not pass the ordinary way, because they were mending of the great stone steps against the Coronacion.
Since my going out of town, there is one Alexander Rosse sent to the Counter by Sir Thomas Allen, for counterfeiting my hand to a ticket.
Comes one with a tickett to invite me to Captain Robert Blake’s buriall, for whose death I am very sorry, and do much wonder at it.
Back again home and to my chamber, to set down in my diary all my late journey, which I do with great pleasure.
Into the City and saw in what forwardness all things are for the Coronacion, which will be very magnificent.
Up among my workmen. Comes my wife to see me and my brother John, who I am glad to see, but I sent them away because of going to the office.
So to bed very sleepy for last night’s work, concluding that it is the pleasantest journey in all respects that ever I had in my life.
I sent to see how my wife do, who is well, and my brother John come from Cambridge.
So home and I found all well, and a deal of work done since I went.
But of all the journeys that ever I made this was the merriest, and I was in a strange mood for mirth.
Mrs. Anne and I rode under the man that hangs upon Shooter’s Hill, and a filthy sight it was to see how his flesh is shrunk to his bones.
I got my Lady to let her maid, Mrs. Anne, to ride all the way on horseback, and she rides exceeding well; and so I called her my clerk.
I asked women whether they would sell me their children. They denied me all, but said they would give me one to keep for them, if I would.
I met two little schoolboys going with pitchers of ale to their schoolmaster, and I did drink of some of one of them and give him two pence.
After we had breakfasted, we sett forth for London, and indeed I was a little troubled to part with Mrs. Rebecca, for which God forgive me.
Called up by Sir W. Batten, so I arose and we did some business, and then came Captn. Allen, and he and I withdrew and sang a song or two.
We were most exceeding merry, and I had the opportunity of kissing Mrs. Rebecca very often.
Having no mind to leave Mrs. Rebecca, what with talk and singing (her father and I), Mrs. Turner and I staid there.
So to Captain Allen’s (where we were last night, and heard him play on the harpsicon, and I find him to be a perfect good musician).
Going home, Mrs. Rebecca would needs have me sing, and I did pretty well and was highly esteemed by them.
Mrs. Rebecca seemed, I know not why, in that and other things, to be desirous of my favours and would in all things show me respects.
We continued dancing an hour or two, and so broke up very pleasant and merry, and so walked home, I leading Mrs. Rebecca.
Mrs. R. Allen danced very well, and seems the best humoured woman that ever I saw.
After we had done eating, the ladies went to dance, and among the men we had, I was forced to dance too; and did make an ugly shift.
We had a fine collacion but I took little pleasure for the illness of the musique and for the intentness of my mind upon Mrs. Rebecca Allen.
Here we had two fiddles, the one a base viall, but both together made the worst musique that ever I heard.
To Hempson’s, a most pretty house, only it had a most ill access on all sides to it, which is a greatest fault that can be in a house.

I find that I begin to know now how to receive so much reverence, which at the beginning I could not tell how to do.
I had a candle brought me and a good fire made, and it was a great pleasure to see how I am respected and honoured by all people.
Waking, I saw my pillow (which overnight I flung from me) stand upright, but not bethinking myself what it might be, I was a little afeard.
Sir William telling me that Edgeborrow did die in my chamber, did make me some what afeard, but not so much as for mirth’s sake I did seem.
